> Since there is no coordination among the various applications, you’re basically stuck playing a game of walls and ladders, hoping that your ladder is taller than everybody else’s wall. The customer has pretty much found the tallest ladder which the window manager provides. There is no “super topmost” flag. Sure, you can try moving to another level of the system, like say creating a custom desktop, but all that does is give you a taller ladder.
